View current balance and recent transactions
(Adjust details to match your actual capabilities)

Features
🏦 Account types: Savings, Current, Student (or others per your project)

💳 Deposit and withdrawal operations

🔄 Transfer funds between accounts

📋 View balance and transaction history

⚠️ Basic input validation and custom error handling

Prerequisites
Java Development Kit (JDK) 8 or higher

(Optional) A Java IDE like IntelliJ IDEA or Eclipse

(Optional) External libraries (if using GUI frameworks or database connectivity)

Installation & Usage
Clone the repository:
bash
Copy
Edit
git clone https://github.com/TayyabAbbas802/Banking-System-in-Java.git
cd Banking-System-in-Java
Compile & Run (Console)
bash
Copy
Edit
javac -d bin src/**/*.java
java -cp bin Bank.Main
Run (GUI, if applicable)
Build using your IDE or GUI tool.

Run Main class under GUI or Bank package.

Example Interaction
Launch the application.

Select account type (Savings, Current, Student).

Create a new account with initial balance.

Deposit, withdraw, or transfer funds.

View balance or transaction history.

Code Highlights
BankAccount hierarchy: Use inheritance to implement common behavior in BankAccount, with specialized subclasses like SavingsAccount, CurrentAccount, etc.

Exception Handling: Custom exceptions (e.g. InsufficientBalanceException, InvalidAmountException) ensure invalid operations are handled gracefully.

Transaction Logging: (If implemented) Records each deposit, withdrawal, or transfer for audit purposes.

Persistence: (If applicable) Data is stored using files, serialization, or a lightweight database.
